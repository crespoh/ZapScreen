-- Fix Chat System RLS Policies - Bypass Authentication Issue
-- The issue is that auth.uid() returns null in SQL editor, but works in app context

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own chat sessions" ON public.chat_sessions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert messages in their sessions" ON public.chat_messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own unlock requests" ON public.unlock_requests;

-- Create more permissive policies that work with app authentication
-- These policies will work when the app is properly authenticated

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own chat sessions" ON public.chat_sessions
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
        -- Allow if user is authenticated (not null) and is the parent
        auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND auth.uid()::text = parent_device_id
    );

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert messages in their sessions" ON public.chat_messages
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
        -- Allow if user is authenticated and session exists
        auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM public.chat_sessions cs
            WHERE cs.id = session_id
            AND auth.uid()::text IN (cs.parent_device_id, cs.child_device_id)
        )
    );

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own unlock requests" ON public.unlock_requests
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
        -- Allow if user is authenticated and is the child
        auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND auth.uid()::text = child_device_id
    );

-- Alternative: Create a function to bypass RLS for chat session creation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_chat_session_for_family(
    p_parent_device_id TEXT,
    p_child_device_id TEXT,
    p_child_name TEXT
