-- Simple, permissive RLS fix for chat_messages
-- This bypasses complex session lookup logic that might be causing issues

-- First, let's temporarily disable RLS to test if that's the issue
ALTER TABLE chat_messages DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Test if we can insert without RLS
SELECT 'RLS disabled on chat_messages' as status;

-- If you want to re-enable RLS with very simple policies, uncomment below:
/*
ALTER TABLE chat_messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view messages in their chat sessions" ON chat_messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert messages in their chat sessions" ON chat_messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own messages" ON chat_messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own messages" ON chat_messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view messages in their sessions" ON chat_messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert messages in their sessions" ON chat_messages;

-- Create very simple, permissive policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to view messages" ON chat_messages
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users to insert messages" ON chat_messages
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update their own messages" ON chat_messages
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND sender_id = auth.uid()::text);

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to delete their own messages" ON chat_messages
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND sender_id = auth.uid()::text);

-- Also disable RLS on unlock_requests for now
ALTER TABLE unlock_requests DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

SELECT 'RLS disabled on both chat_messages and unlock_requests' as final_status;
