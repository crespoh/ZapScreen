# Phase 3D: API Integration & Testing Plan

## Overview
Phase 3D focuses on testing the complete end-to-end multi-child and QR code pairing system to ensure all components work together seamlessly.

## Testing Checklist

### 1. QR Code Generation & Scanning
- [ ] **Child Device QR Code Generation**
  - [ ] QR code contains correct device information
  - [ ] Device token is included (if available)
  - [ ] QR code refreshes properly
  - [ ] QR code can be shared

- [ ] **Parent Device QR Code Scanning**
  - [ ] Camera permission is requested
  - [ ] QR code is scanned and parsed correctly
  - [ ] Device information is displayed
  - [ ] Registration form is shown

### 2. Child Device Registration
- [ ] **Registration Process**
  - [ ] Child name can be entered
  - [ ] Device token is passed from QR code
  - [ ] Registration succeeds in Supabase
  - [ ] Parent-child relationship is created
  - [ ] Success message is shown

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully
  - [ ] Duplicate registration is prevented
  - [ ] Invalid QR codes are rejected

### 3. Family Dashboard
- [ ] **Dashboard Display**
  - [ ] Family summary is loaded
  - [ ] Child cards are displayed
  - [ ] Activity statistics are shown
  - [ ] Empty state is handled

- [ ] **Child Selection**
  - [ ] Child selector works
  - [ ] Individual child statistics are loaded
  - [ ] Date range filtering works

### 4. Usage Statistics Integration
- [ ] **Local Statistics**
  - [ ] Usage records are saved locally
  - [ ] Statistics are calculated correctly
  - [ ] Date filtering works

- [ ] **Supabase Sync**
  - [ ] Usage records sync to Supabase
  - [ ] Statistics sync to Supabase
  - [ ] Child name is included in sync

### 5. Multi-Child Support
- [ ] **Multiple Children**
  - [ ] Multiple children can be registered
  - [ ] Each child's data is separate
  - [ ] Parent can view all children

- [ ] **Child-Specific Features**
  - [ ] Child-specific usage statistics
  - [ ] Child-specific app shielding
  - [ ] Child-specific unlock requests

### 6. Push Notifications
- [ ] **Unlock Requests**
  - [ ] Child can send unlock requests
  - [ ] Parent receives notifications
  - [ ] Parent can approve/deny requests

- [ ] **Unlock Commands**
  - [ ] Parent can send unlock commands
  - [ ] Child receives notifications
  - [ ] Apps are unlocked for specified time

### 7. App Shielding
- [ ] **Multi-Child Shielding**
  - [ ] Each child can have different shielded apps
  - [ ] Shielding works per child device
  - [ ] Unshielding works per child device

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Child Setup
1. Child device generates QR code
2. Parent device scans QR code
3. Parent registers child with name
4. Verify child appears in family dashboard
5. Test usage statistics for this child

### Scenario 2: Multiple Children Setup
1. Register first child (as above)
2. Register second child
3. Verify both children appear in dashboard
4. Test switching between children
5. Verify separate statistics for each child

### Scenario 3: End-to-End Usage Flow
1. Child requests app unlock
2. Parent receives notification
3. Parent approves request
4. Child receives unlock command
5. App is unlocked for specified time
6. Usage is recorded and synced

### Scenario 4: Error Handling
1. Test network disconnection during registration
2. Test invalid QR code scanning
3. Test duplicate child registration
4. Test authorization failures

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All QR code operations work correctly
- [ ] All registration operations succeed
- [ ] All dashboard features work
- [ ] All usage statistics are accurate
- [ ] All push notifications work
- [ ] All app shielding works per child

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] QR code generation < 1 second
- [ ] QR code scanning < 2 seconds
- [ ] Registration process < 3 seconds
- [ ] Dashboard loading < 2 seconds
- [ ] Statistics sync < 5 seconds

### Error Handling Requirements
- [ ] All network errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] All user errors show helpful messages
- [ ] No crashes occur during normal operation
- [ ] App recovers from errors automatically

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Two iOS devices (parent and child)
2. Both devices have the app installed
3. Both devices are logged in to Supabase
4. Family Controls authorization is granted on both devices

### Test Execution
1. Follow each test scenario step by step
2. Document any issues or unexpected behavior
3. Verify all success criteria are met
4. Test error conditions and edge cases

### Reporting
- Document all test results
- Note any bugs or issues found
- Verify performance requirements
- Confirm all features work as expected

## Next Steps After Phase 3D
- Phase 4: Advanced Features (if needed)
- Phase 5: Performance Optimization
- Phase 6: Production Deployment
